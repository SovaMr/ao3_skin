# AO3 Page Style Skin

A dark-mode skin for AO3.

Due to continous issues with style, I created a CSS that ensures that the text is in dark-mode, it's justified, and there's a 2 px line witdh.

# AO3 Work Style Skin

It's a CSS that ensures that the work is justified with line height of 2 px, and there's a bottom bargin of 3% after each paragraph.
